# Lab Assignment 08

## Goals:

- Create a ToDo list App.

## Problem:

1. Create a new React app and a new GitHub repository. Do not modify your previous React
app and GitHub repository. I am going to need that to grade your assignment 07.
2. For this assignment you only need the App.js component.
3. Create a Todo list app. You can use useRef() and useState() hooks for the todo list.
4. You web page will have an input box and a add button.
5. After writing something inside the input box and pressing the add button that text will be
added in your website.
6. You also need to implement the logic of removing items from the Todo list.
7. You must need to beautify your app using CSS / Bootstrap.
8. The points of your work are divided into two parts. 80 points (40 for adding items 40 for
removing item from the list) for the working Todo List and 20 points for styling your
app.
9. These are the stylings you must have:

  a. The content of your web page needs to be displayed in the center of the window.
  
  b. There should be a nice-looking background image or color. If you use a
  background image it can’t be repeated.

  c. You can’t use the default input box and button need to add some styles.
  
  d. The list item you add should have a border, background color.
  
  e. The even items and odd item of the Todo list should have a different background
  color
  
  f. When you hover your mouse over the list it should have a nice background color
  and a text color.

10. You can use the following website as a reference. Try to mimic this website.

## Submission and Grade (100 points):

1. You must need to submit your GitHub repository. Otherwise, 50 points will be deducted.
2. Must need to submit the AWS live website. Otherwise, another 50 points will be
deduced.
3. In case if you have some problem in the AWS, you can create a small screen recoding
displaying adding some items to the list and remove some items. This will cause a
penalty of 10 points. That means if you submit GitHub repo and screen recording you
will receive maximum 90 points.

Create a text file enter both the GitHub repo link and website then submit that text file on
ecampus.

## Deadline:

The assignment is due Wednesday midnight (November 16th).
